Firefox Extension that injects CSS into WP Admin automatically.

# idea
Working with Wordpress on a Daily Basis does kinda grow monotenous... also i like to rice my setups.
Sooo I decided to write a Simple extension that allows me to Inject CSS into all Wordpress Backends.

# Disclaimer
This is my first Firefox Extension, so it will be a little Rough around the edges.
Also i need to see if injecting Stuff into Wordpress Backends might pose a potential Risk....
